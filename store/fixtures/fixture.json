Where he learned to hone his skills to fill up both a sound of an orchestration and the page it's self.  He became involved in a city-wide multimedia production called \"Gethsemane,\" which portrayed the stages of Christ's crucifixion in a very contemporary way. This production involved composed music from the rock, classical, and contemporary styles (sometimes all at the same time), it involved computer music, psycho-acoustics, audience participation, video production (mostly improvised video direction), spoken word, live and recorded performance of music, theater and dance. The show was a success: The Palm Beach Sentinel actually heralded the production as \"...both eye opening and mystifying. One of PBA's best!!\"\r\n\r\nHe also studied at Colorado State University as a Music Performance concentration and at the Lamont School of Music, at the University of Denver, as a Music Composition / Film Music Bachelors.
